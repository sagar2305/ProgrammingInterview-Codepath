# Pre-work - *CodePath Programming Interview*

Submitted by: Sagar Mutha

## Checkpoint 2

* [x] Print concentric rectangular pattern in a 2d matrix - https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/prettyprint/

## Checkpoint 3

* [x] Find the kth smallest element in an unsorted array of non-negative integers -  https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-the-array/

* [x] Given an array of non negative integers A, and a range (B, C), find the number of continuous subsequences in the array which have sum S in the range [B, C] or B <= S <= C - https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/numrange/


## Checkpoint 4

* [x] Given a singly linked list, modify the value of first half nodes such that :

1st node’s new value = the last node’s value - first node’s current value
2nd node’s new value = the second last node’s value - 2nd node’s current value,
and so on … - https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/subtract/

* [x] Given an array, find the next greater element G[i] for every element A[i] in the array. The Next greater Element for an element A[i] is the first greater element on the right side of A[i] in array. 
More formally,

G[i] for an element A[i] = an element A[j] such that 
    j is minimum possible AND 
    j > i AND
    A[j] > A[i]
Elements for which no greater element exist, consider next greater element as -1. - https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/nextgreater/

## Checkpoint 5

* [x] Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Example: 
Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity. - https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/

* [x] Given a collection of numbers that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations.

Example :
[1,1,2] have the following unique permutations:

[1,1,2]
[1,2,1]
[2,1,1] - https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/all-unique-permutations/
